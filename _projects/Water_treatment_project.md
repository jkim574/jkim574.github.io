## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and reliability of compact Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems in nitrate-affected communities. Leveraging **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and **graph neural networks (GATs)**, the system can:
- Detect sensor anomalies and track nonlinear correlations among key water-treatment variables (e.g., turbidity, flow rate, pressure, pH).
- Enable data-driven **predictive control** by adjusting operational parameters (like pressure or coagulant dosing) based on real-time sensor feedback.
- Reduce operational overhead and extend cleaning intervals, lowering overall maintenance costs and improving sustainability.

Funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, the California State Department of Water Resources, and the U.S. National Alliance for Water Innovation, this collaborative effort unites researchers from California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

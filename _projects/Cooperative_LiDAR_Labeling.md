## Overview
This project explores the **attentional dynamics** involved in a breath-counting meditation practice:
- Implements a **dynamic systems model** with an exponential decay function to simulate the gradual loss of focus during longer breath-counting cycles.
- Maps error likelihood to the model’s current “attention level,” reflecting empirical observations that participants are more prone to mistakes as their attention wanes.
- Calibrates key parameters (decay rates, min/max error thresholds) by comparing simulation outputs to real human data, validating the model’s fit to actual performance trends.
- Provides insights into **cognitive and neuropsychological** mechanisms behind mindfulness exercises, offering a quantifiable way to explore attentional lapses over time.
